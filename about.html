        <p>Howdy! As fellow students, we understand how crucial it is that you get the perfect college schedule. That's where ProfFinder comes in. We've compiled data
            about the core Texas A&M freshman engineering courses to help incoming Aggie engineers construct a schedule that they can be proud of. Filter by different
            course times, check for scheduling conflicts, review professor ratings, and more. Happy scheduling and gig 'em!
